# Hosting ipynbs with GitHub Pages
A tutorial/example on how to use GitHub pages to host python notebook files as web pages.  Please see [here](https://adamspannbauer.github.io/hosting-ipynbs-with-GitHub-Pages/) for the full document (which was made as an .ipynb file!).

### Quick overview instructions

* [Make a Github repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository)
* Make an R Markdown file you're proud of and want to share with the world!
* Export the notebook to html
* Name the html document `index.html`
* Get the `index.html` file into your GitHub repo
  * Long term I recommend to find a Git+GitHub tutorial and learn how to interact with git.  It's such a useful skill for so many different things!
    * [here's a great one if you're just getting started with git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)
  * Short-term you can use the <kbd>Add file</kbd> button followed by clicking <kbd>Upload files</kbd>

* Turn on GitHub pages for the repo by clicking:
  * <kbd>Settings</kbd>
  * <kbd>Pages</kbd> (under the Code and automation section in the sidebar)
  * Find the dropdown menu in the **Branch** section of the page and select "main" (there's a chance you want to select "master")
    * If you're new to GitHub there's probably only one option to choose, choose that one option that's not "None"
  * Click the <kbd>Save</kbd> button
* Wait!
* Find your website online at:`https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name/`
